You'll need the following to get started:

+ [An Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021). We use the Arduino Uno, but any standard Arduino is appropriate for this project.
+ [A breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002).
+ [A piezo speaker](http://www.oddwires.com/piezo-element-multicomp-g2310-4128-with-mounting-holes/). Any simple speaker will do; we use a piezo speaker because it is inexpensive and it suits our needs. 
+ [A 1000 ohm resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969). Although we use a 1000 ohm resistor, you should feel free experiment with different values to see how it affects the result. You may also need a different value for your resistor if you use a speaker other than the one we suggested using.
+ [Wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9194) for wiring.
